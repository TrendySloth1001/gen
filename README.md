## Dark Hello Next.js

A minimal dark-themed Next.js starter using the App Router, TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind v4. The landing screen lives in src/app/page.tsx.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the page. Update src/app/page.tsx or src/app/globals.css to tweak the hero and styling; changes hot-reload automatically.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the dev server on http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` – create a production build
- `npm start` – run the production server after a build
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint

## Deployment

Any Next.js-compatible host works (e.g., Vercel, Netlify). Build with `npm run build` and serve with `npm start`.
